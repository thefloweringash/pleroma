## About 

Pleroma is a microblogging server software that can federate (= exchange
messages with) other servers that support ActivityPub. What that means is that
you can host a server for yourself or your friends and stay in control of your
online identity, but still exchange messages with people on larger servers.
Pleroma will federate with all servers that implement ActivityPub, like
Friendica, GNU Social, Hubzilla, Mastodon, Misskey, Peertube, and Pixelfed.
